## Day 10: Arrays (1D) & Combined Concepts

*   **Problem Title:** **"Product Discount Calculator"**
*   **Scenario:** You're optimizing a discount system for an online store. Some products get a flat discount, while others get a percentage off, but only if they meet certain criteria.
*   **Task:**
    *   Read an integer `N`, representing the number of products.
    *   Create two arrays: one for `originalPrices` (`double`) and one for `discountPercentages` (`int`).
    *   Read `N` `double` values into `originalPrices`.
    *   Read `N` `int` values into `discountPercentages`. (A `0` in `discountPercentages` means no percentage discount, but a potential flat discount.)
    *   For each product, calculate its `finalPrice` based on these rules:
        *   If `discountPercentages[i]` is greater than 0, apply `discountPercentages[i]` as a percentage off the `originalPrices[i]`.
        *   Otherwise (if `discountPercentages[i]` is 0), if `originalPrices[i]` is greater than or equal to `50.00`, apply a flat discount of `10.00`.
        *   Otherwise (no percentage discount and price < 50.00), there is no discount, `finalPrice` is `originalPrices[i]`.
    *   Print all `N` `finalPrice` values, each formatted to two decimal places and separated by a space on a single line.
*   **Sample Input:**
    ```
    4
    100.00 45.00 75.00 20.00
    10 0 0 0
    ```
*   **Sample Output:**
    ```
    90.00 45.00 65.00 20.00
    ```
    *Explanation of Sample Output:*
    *   Product 1: 100.00 with 10% discount -> 90.00
    *   Product 2: 45.00 with 0% discount, price < 50 -> 45.00
    *   Product 3: 75.00 with 0% discount, price >= 50 -> 75.00 - 10.00 = 65.00
    *   Product 4: 20.00 with 0% discount, price < 50 -> 20.00
*   **Key Concepts:** Multiple arrays, `for` loop, complex `if-else if-else` logic, percentage calculation, mixed discount types, formatted output.
